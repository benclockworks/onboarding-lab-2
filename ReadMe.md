Fill out this readme as required by lab guidance
Exercise1 - Exhaustive Testing:
advantage=test hedgecases,disadvantage=takes time and resources?
Excercise 2- Sampling initial values:
advantage= see wether inputs behave properly, disadvantage= missing hedgecases?
Excercise 3- Hundreds of cycles:
advantage= test hedgecases in initialization and test excercise 1 and 2, disadvantage= time and resources and quality of tests need to be high and in a predictable order to test prior experiments
